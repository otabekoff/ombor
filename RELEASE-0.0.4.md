## ✨ What's New

### 🧪 Testing Infrastructure
- **Added Vitest Testing Framework** with 183 comprehensive tests
- **100% Test Pass Rate** - All tests passing successfully
- **Test Coverage**: 8 test suites covering:
  - ✅ Basic CRUD operations (38 tests)
  - ✅ Filtering & Sorting (31 tests)
  - ✅ Method chaining (24 tests)
  - ✅ Database configuration (23 tests)
  - ✅ Multiple collections (39 tests)
  - ✅ Performance benchmarks (16 tests)
  - ✅ Edge cases (12 tests)
- **fake-indexeddb** integration for Node.js testing
- **Test execution time**: ~7-8 seconds (optimized)

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

Fixed **7 major bugs** discovered through comprehensive testing:

1. **isSubset null handling** - Fixed crash when querying with null values
   - Added null/undefined guards before Object.keys()
   - Prevents unhandled exceptions in filtering operations

2. **Sorting null crashes** - Fixed crash when sorting collections with null values
   - Added null/undefined handling in sorting comparisons
   - Null values now sorted to the end

3. **Numeric sorting bug** - Fixed incorrect alphabetical sorting of numbers
   - Implemented type-aware comparison (numeric vs string)
   - Numbers now sort correctly: 1, 2, 10 (not 1, 10, 2)

4. **doc().get() returning empty object** - Fixed return value consistency
   - Now correctly returns `undefined` when document not found
   - Matches expected API behavior

5. **limit(0) returning null** - Fixed edge case handling
   - Now correctly returns empty array `[]` instead of null
   - Consistent with expected array return type

6. **Database deletion not completing** - Fixed async operation handling
   - Added proper event handlers (onsuccess, onerror, onblocked)
   - Database now fully deleted before promise resolves

7. **Negative limit handling** - Fixed graceful error handling
   - Negative limits now treated as 0 (return empty array)
   - More user-friendly than throwing errors
