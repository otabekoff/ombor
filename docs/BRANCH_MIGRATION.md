# ‚úÖ Git Branch Migration Complete: master ‚Üí main

## What Was Done

### 1. Changed Default Branch on GitHub
```bash
gh repo edit otabekoff/ombor --default-branch main
```
‚úÖ GitHub now uses `main` as the default branch

### 2. Deleted Remote `master` Branch
```bash
git push origin --delete master
```
‚úÖ Removed `master` from GitHub repository

### 3. Deleted Local `master` Branch
```bash
git branch -d master
```
‚úÖ Removed local `master` branch

### 4. Updated Remote HEAD Pointer
```bash
git remote set-head origin -a
```
‚úÖ `origin/HEAD` now points to `main`

---

## Current Branch Setup

**Local Branches:**
- ‚úÖ `main` (active)

**Remote Branches (origin):**
- ‚úÖ `main` (default)

**Remote HEAD:**
- ‚úÖ `origin/HEAD` ‚Üí `origin/main`

---

## Verification

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch
# Output: * main

# Check all branches
git branch -a
# Should only show main branches, no master

# Check remote HEAD
git remote show origin
# Should show HEAD branch: main
```

---

## What This Means

1. **GitHub Default:** When anyone visits your repo, they see `main` branch
2. **Clone Behavior:** New clones will checkout `main` by default
3. **Pull Requests:** New PRs will target `main` by default
4. **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions will run on `main` branch
5. **No More master:** The old `master` branch is completely removed

---

## Your Workflow Now

```bash
# Working with your repository
git pull origin main           # Pull latest changes
git push origin main           # Push your changes
git checkout -b feature-name   # Create feature branches from main

# Creating releases
npm run release                # Creates tags from main
git push --tags origin main    # Push tags
```

---

## For Collaborators

If others have clones of your repo with `master`, they should run:

```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Update remote HEAD
git remote set-head origin -a

# Delete their local master (optional)
git branch -d master

# Set main as default for future pulls
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
```

---

## Note About Upstream

You still have an `upstream` remote (pointing to the original localbase repo):
- `remotes/upstream/main`
- `remotes/upstream/master`

This is fine - it's a different repository. Your `origin` (otabekoff/ombor) is now clean with only `main`.

## ‚úÖ Summary

**Before:**
- ‚ùå Had both `main` and `master` branches
- ‚ùå `master` was default on GitHub
- ‚ùå Confusing which branch to use

**After:**
- ‚úÖ Only `main` branch exists
- ‚úÖ `main` is default on GitHub
- ‚úÖ Clean, modern Git workflow
- ‚úÖ Follows GitHub best practices

**Your repository is now using `main` as the sole default branch!** üéâ
