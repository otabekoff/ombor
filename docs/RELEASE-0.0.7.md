# 🚀 Release v0.0.7 - Universal Browser Compatibility Fix

**Release Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Ready to Publish

---

## 🎯 **What's Fixed in v0.0.7**

### Critical Bug Fix: `process is not defined` Error

**Problem:**  
The playground and any browser usage of Ombor v0.0.6 from CDN was throwing:
```
ReferenceError: process is not defined
```

**Root Cause:**  
- The `process` object doesn't exist in browser environments
- Old build configuration didn't replace `process.env` references
- CDN was serving v0.0.6 which had this bug

**Solution:**  
Updated `vite.config.ts` to define `process.env` for browser compatibility:
```typescript
define: {
  'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production'),
  'process.env': JSON.stringify({})
}
```

---

## 🔧 **Changes Included**

### 1. **Browser Compatibility Fix**
- ✅ Added `define` configuration in vite.config.ts
- ✅ Replaces all `process.env` references at build time
- ✅ UMD build now works in all browsers

### 2. **Smart Playground Loading**
- ✅ Detects localhost vs production environment
- ✅ Uses local build for development/preview
- ✅ Uses CDN for production (GitHub Pages)
- ✅ Works everywhere: dev, preview, production

### 3. **Code Quality**
- ✅ Fixed formatting in delete.js (CI fix)
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Linting passing
- ✅ Type checking passing

### 4. **Documentation**
- ✅ Fixed dead links in docs
- ✅ Updated VitePress base path detection
- ✅ Improved playground error messages
