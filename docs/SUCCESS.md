## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Handle GitHub Security Alerts
GitHub detected 21 vulnerabilities (8 critical, 7 high):
- These are likely in `devDependencies` (Vite, Vitest, etc.)
- Your production code has 0 vulnerabilities
- Run `npm audit` to review
- Most can be safely ignored for development dependencies

### 2. Expand Test Suite
Current tests only cover basic functionality. Add tests for:
```typescript
// src/__tests__/actions.test.ts
- add() operations
- get() operations
- update() operations
- set() operations
- delete() operations

// src/__tests__/filters.test.ts
- orderBy() with different directions
- limit() functionality
- chaining filters

// src/__tests__/selectors.test.ts
- collection() selector
- doc() selector with objects
- doc() selector with keys
```

### 3. Publish to npm
Once you're ready:
```bash
# Make sure you're logged in to npm
npm login

# Publish the package
npm publish

# Or if using GitHub packages:
npm publish --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

### 4. Create First Official Release
```bash
# Once tests are comprehensive, create v0.1.0
npm run release:minor

# Push with tags
git push --follow-tags origin main
```

### 5. Update Documentation
- Update README with new npm installation instructions
- Add examples of TypeScript usage
- Create API documentation with TypeDoc
- Add usage examples
